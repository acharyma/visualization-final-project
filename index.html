                   The Bar Graph plots the Income Per Capita for each of the different district in Nepal. The bar graph has a sort function that toggles between ascending and descending order.
                   When a Bar is clicked, that district gets highlighted on the bar graph, and the line chart displays the progression of dropout rates in that district throughout the different grades. We set it to default to Kathmandu, Nepal because it is the capital city/district of the country.
                   The selected district are also saved for when the map is revealed.
               </p>
               <h2>Click on the Bar Graph to see the dropout rates in the district by grade! This will also save and highlight the district when the map is revealed and on the Bar Graph as a "District of Interest"</h2>
