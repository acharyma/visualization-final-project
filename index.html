            <div><p>
                In Nepal, agriculture is the mainstay of the economy, providing a livelihood for three-fourths of the population and accounting for a little over one-third of GDP. (cite globaledge.msu.edu) In addition, at the district level, the ones which generate the highest revenue per capita are: Manang, Kathmandu, Mustang, Lalitpur and Solukhumbu; with the highest being Manang with $3,166 and the lowest being Bajhang with $487. 

                Another connection that we came to realize is that the less per cer capita the district had the  dropout rate was likely to increase from grade 1 to 10. If the Dritric had a high revenue per capita the dropout rate was decreasing from 1 to 10th grade.

                Moreover, to give a better understanding, we felt a comparison with the United States would be necessary. For example the highest state with income per capita is â€œWashington, D.C has the highest per capita personal income with $71,496 and Mississippi had the lowest per-capita real GDP, at 35,015 U.S. dollars. 

                Income inequality within Nepal takes different forms. For example, one of the driving forces is Neoliberal policies. These policies  have driven cuts to public spending and increased privatization in Nepal. As a result, public services like health and education have also seen increased privatization and commercialization in Nepal. These bring about two different consequences; for the rich it creates a circumstance where they are able to pay for and support private services. While public sector services are starved of funding and political support.

                <br><br>These Inequalities can affect development also through its effect on the political economy of the provision of public goods. For example, in Nepal, as incomes and living standards have improved, private school enrollments have increased leaving public schools, especially in remote rural areas, struggling to fill classrooms. This weakened demand will inevitably lead to further lowering of quality of public schools, which remain the preserve of the poorest.
                Access to education is limited by geographical constraints, poor infrastructure, social and cultural norms, and a lack of well-trained teachers. See below for the relationship dropout rates in different districts.

               <p>
                   The Bar Graph plots the Income Per Capita for each of the different district in Nepal. The bar graph has a sort function that toggles between ascending and descending order.
                   When a Bar is clicked, that district gets highlighted on the bar graph, and the line chart displays the progression of dropout rates in that district throughout the different grades. We set it to default to Kathmandu, Nepal because it is the capital city/district of the country.
                   The selected district are also saved for when the map is revealed. When the map is revealed, there is a blue outline on the selected districts (from the Bar Graph). As of now, the map only shows the region and district on hover, but once we merge the three datasets we use to one (for the final product), we will display the information about that district in full (including dropouts, total number of teachers, life expectancy, etc) when a district is clicked. We also made the border of the district red to distinguish between the interested districts and the districts actually looked at.
                    If time permits, we want to try and get a map of the United States to compare the dropout rates in the different states and compare it with the different districts for the final project.
